Subject: [PATCH] rpi-firmware: support custom version selection

Since the rpi-firmware supplies firmware binaries that have the
potential to depend on kernel drivers, we've matched kernel versions to
rpi-firmware versions. In order to simplify using different Linux kernel
versions, this adds an option to set the tag or hash to use. For
example, if you're using the Raspberry Pi Linux kernel tagged
`1.20200902`, you can now use the rpi-firmware version that was tagged
`1.20200902`.
