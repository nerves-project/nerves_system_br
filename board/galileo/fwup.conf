#
# +----------------------------+
# | MBR                        |
# +----------------------------+
# | p0: EFI partition (FAT16)  |
# +----------------------------+
# | p1*: Rootfs A (squashfs)   |
# +----------------------------+
# | p1*: Rootfs B (squashfs)   |
# +----------------------------+
# | p2: Application (FAT32)    |
# +----------------------------+
#
# The p1 partition points to whichever of Rootfs A or B that
# is active.
#
# The image is sized to be less than 1 GB so that it fits on
# nearly any SDCard around. If you have a larger SDCard and
# need more space, feel free to bump the partition sizes
# below.
