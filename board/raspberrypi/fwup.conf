# This configuration file will create an image that
# has an MBR and the following 3 partitions:
#
# +----------------------------+
# | MBR                        |
# +----------------------------+
# | p0: Boot partition (FAT32) |
# | zImage, bootcode.bin,      |
# | config.txt, etc.           |
# +----------------------------+
# | p1*: Rootfs A (EXT4)       |
# +----------------------------+
# | p1*: Rootfs B (EXT4)       |
# +----------------------------+
# | p2: Application (FAT32)    |
# +----------------------------+
#
# The partition p1 points to whichever of Rootfs A or B that
# is active.
#
# The image is sized to be less than 1 GB so that it fits on
# nearly any SDCard around. If you have a larger SDCard and
# need more space, feel free to bump the partition sizes
# below.

# The Raspberry Pi is incredibly picky on the partition sizes
# and in ways that I don't understand. Test changes one at a
# time to make sure that they boot. (Sizes are in 512 byte
# blocks)
