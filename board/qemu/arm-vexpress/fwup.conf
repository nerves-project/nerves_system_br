# This configuration file will create an image that

#
# +----------------------------+
# | MBR                        |
# +----------------------------+
# | p1*: Rootfs A (squashfs)   |
# +----------------------------+
# | p1*: Rootfs B (squashfs)   |
# +----------------------------+
# | p2: Application (FAT32)    |
# +----------------------------+
# | p3: Used (FAT32)           |
# +----------------------------+
#
# The p1 partition points to whichever of Rootfs A or B that
# is active. The p3 is used as a hack to pad any generated
# image file out so that it includes room for p2. Qemu wants
# this since it won't expand a raw image file.

# Let the rootfs have room to grow up to 128 MiB. Don't
# worry about boundaries since we're using qemu
