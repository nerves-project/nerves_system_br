	help
	  Linux kernels prior to Linux 5.6 had many blocking issues when enough
	  entropy was not available at early boot. This caused many hangs and
	  was quite hard to debug if you weren't aware of the issue. As a
	  result, Nerves automatically set BR2_PACKAGE_RNG_TOOLS=y. This is no
	  longer an issue, so systems should choose whether they need it or not.
	  Select this to accept that you have seen this message and taking the
	  appropriate action for your Nerves system.
